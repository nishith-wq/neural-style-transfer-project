# Neural Network Classifier using Keras

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple feedforward neural network using the Keras API from TensorFlow. It serves as an introductory hands-on guide for beginners interested in understanding the core concepts of deep learning, including model construction, training, evaluation, and performance visualization. The neural network built in this project is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a fundamental building block for many modern AI systems.

The objective is to classify input data into different categories by learning from labeled examples. This type of supervised learning approach is applicable across a wide range of real-world problems such as digit recognition, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.

## Project Highlights

-  Full machine learning pipeline using Keras
-  Modular and intuitive model built with `Sequential` API
-  Uses ReLU and Softmax activations for non-linear learning
-  Tracks training accuracy and loss over epochs
-  Visualizes model performance using Matplotlib

##  Model Architecture

The neural network designed in this project is composed of:

- **Input Layer:** Accepts numerical feature vectors
- **Hidden Layers:** One or more dense layers with ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity
- **Output Layer:** Softmax layer for multi-class classification

The model is compiled with `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function, `adam` as the optimizer for adaptive gradient updates, and `accuracy` as the evaluation metric.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   The input features are normalized for efficient training. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets.

2. **Model Construction:**  
   The architecture is defined using Keras' `Sequential` model. Layers are added incrementally to define the flow of data through the network.

3. **Training:**  
   The model is trained over multiple epochs. During training, it learns to minimize loss using backpropagation and gradient descent.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   After training, the modelâ€™s performance is assessed on a test dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are computed.

5. **Visualization:**  
   Training and validation accuracy/loss trends are plotted using Matplotlib to analyze learning behavior and detect overfitting or underfitting.
